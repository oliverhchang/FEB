,Torsional Stiffness Tracker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The purpose of this spreadsheet is to have a running tracker of torsional stiffness values across configurations of the chassis. This way, we are able to identify the contributions to torsional stiffness of each change and find the running change in torsional stiffness across iterations!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
